# Liquid State Machine (LSM)

The Liquid State Machine (LSM) ([Maass et. al. 2002][1]) is a computational model
which uses the high-dimensional, complex dynamics of recurrent neural circuits to
conduct memory-dependent readout operations on continuous input streams.

This package provides a convenience wrapper for network construction, as well as typical
operations on the reservoir.
